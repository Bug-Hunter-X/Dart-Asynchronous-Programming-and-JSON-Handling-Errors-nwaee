# Dart Asynchronous Programming and JSON Handling Errors

This repository demonstrates a common error when working with asynchronous operations (using `async` and `await`) and handling JSON responses in Dart. The `bug.dart` file shows the error-prone code, while `bugSolution.dart` presents the improved solution.

## The Problem

The original code attempts to fetch data from a remote API.  It might fail due to network issues, invalid JSON, or the API returning an unexpected structure. The error handling is insufficient and could lead to crashes or unexpected behavior.

## The Solution

The improved version uses better error handling and defensive programming techniques. It thoroughly checks HTTP status codes, handles JSON decoding errors gracefully, and prevents potential null pointer exceptions when accessing JSON fields.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `bug.dart` to see the error.
3. Run `bugSolution.dart` to see the corrected version.
